<h2>Who We Are</h2>

<h3 class="about-us">British Linkz, was designed to keep the world at large, current with the happenings of Jamaican pop culture; whether dance, music, current affairs etc via the use of social platforms such as; Youtube, Soundcloud, Facebook and with the aid of affiliates such as Dre1allaince Ent. CEO Romario English founded British Linkz, on the 21st of January, 2015 after an engaging discussion about how Jamaican art was lacking in itâ€™s digital distribution and as a result falling short to the likes of other Caribbean countries as well as other Afrocentric cultures due to a lack of application and opportunity. British Linkz offers promotional services, artiste management, and all graphic/image work for companies & sole proprietors.</h3>
